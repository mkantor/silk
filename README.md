# silk

Silk is an embedded DSL for authoring HTML from TypeScript. You write simple
typed [JSX][jsx] and Silk generates [`ReadableStream`s][readable-stream] of
[`HTMLToken`s][html-tokens].

Child nodes and attributes can be async values or streams.

Here's an example:

```tsx
import { createElement } from '@matt.kantor/silk'

const document = (
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <title>Greeting</title>
    </head>
    <body>Hello, {slowlyGetPlanet()}!</body>
  </html>
)

const slowlyGetPlanet = (): Promise<ReadableHTMLTokenStream> =>
  new Promise(resolve =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve(<strong>world</strong>), 2000),
  )
```

The HTML structure and content before the `slowlyGetPlanet` call will
immediately be readable from the `document` stream, while the rest will appear
as soon as the `Promise` returned by `slowlyGetPlanet` resolves.

## Setup

To use Silk, add these options to your `tsconfig.json`[^1]:
```json
"jsx": "react",
"jsxFactory": "createElement",
"jsxFragmentFactory": "createElement",
```

Also, `import { createElement } from '@matt.kantor/silk'` in each of your `.tsx`
files.

## Server-Side Usage

If you're using Silk for server-side rendering and want a stream to pipe out as
the HTTP response, `HTMLSerializingTransformStream` has you covered. Here's an
example of an HTTP server which uses Silk to serve a web page:

```tsx
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { Writable } from 'node:stream'
import {
  type ReadableHTMLTokenStream,
  createElement,
  HTMLSerializingTransformStream,
} from '@matt.kantor/silk'

const port = 80

createServer((_request, response) => {
  const document = (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Greeting</title>
      </head>
      <body>Hello, {slowlyGetPlanet()}!</body>
    </html>
  )

  response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
  document
    .pipeThrough(
      new HTMLSerializingTransformStream({
        includeDoctype: true,
      }),
    )
    .pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(response))
    .catch(console.error)
}).listen(port)

const slowlyGetPlanet = (): Promise<ReadableHTMLTokenStream> =>
  new Promise(resolve =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve(<strong>world</strong>), 2000),
  )
```

If you run that and make a request to it from a web browser, you'll see "Hello,
" appear quickly, then "world!" appear after two seconds. You can [try it on

## Client-Side Usage

Silk can also be used client-side by translating the stream of
[`HTMLToken`s][html-tokens] into DOM method calls. You can [see a complete
example of this on StackBlitz][silk-example-client-stackblitz].

## Why?

HTML is inherently streamable, yet many JavaScript web servers buffer the entire
response body before sending a single byte of it to the client. This leaves
performance on the tableâ€”web browsers are perfectly capable of incrementally
parsing and rendering partial HTML documents as they arrive.

Streaming is especially valuable when the document references external resources
(e.g. stylesheets). By sending HTML to the client while the server continues
asynchronous work, the browser can fetch those resources concurrently with that
work, significantly reducing the time required to display the page.

[^1]: `"jsx": "react"` may seem odd because Silk isn't related to React, but
TypeScript's JSX configuration is based around React's semantics.
